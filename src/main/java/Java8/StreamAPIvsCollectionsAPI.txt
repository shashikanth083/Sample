Collections API vs Stream API

1. Collections APIs are in use from java 1.2 and Stream APIs are introduced in java 8.
2. Collection API used to store data on different type of data structures whereas Stream API is used to perform computations on these data.
3. With Collection API we can store a finite number of elements in a data structure.
   With Stream API, we can handle streams of data that can contain infinite number of elements.
4. Collection API constructs objects in an eager manner. Stream API creates objects in a lazy manner.
5. Most of the Collection APIs support iteration and consumption of elements multiple times.
   With Stream API we can consume or iterate elements only once.

Iterator vs Spliterator
1. Iterator was introduced in jdk 1.2 while Spliterator is introduced in jdk 1.8
2. Iterator is used for Collection API while Spliterator is used for Stream API
3. Iterator can be used for iterating the elements in Collection in sequential order
   while Spliterator can be used for iterating the Stream elements in parallel or sequential order.
